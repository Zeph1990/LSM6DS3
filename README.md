# LSM6DS3 6-axis Accelerometer & Gyroscope 
Python module for LSM6DS3 6-axis Accelerometer &amp; Gyroscope support for raspberry pi.

This module can be used to fetch raw data from the LSM6DS3 and to get rotation angles in deg from the accelerometer.

Note : it can be necessary to edit lines 12 and 13. The address can be found on the sensor while the ADC_ref variable must be setted at the right voltage depending on your board
